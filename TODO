1. Docs! Docs! Lotsa work on the docs.
2. Do the equilibrium Spectra
3. MemoryError for large N:
        Expand the "evolve" wrapper function to chunk the time interval, set the initial
        conditions, then run the bbgky function for each chunk
        Modify the bbgky function accordingly i.e. to return the correlations and the
        final state (either in parallel or after gathering, whichever works best)
4. Evaluate site correlations as functions of time and dump the whole data to parallel hdf5
