1. Docs! Docs! Lotsa work on the docs.
2. Do the equilibrium Spectra
3. MemoryError for large N:
	Create another python submodule with cipy.ode instead of lsode routine from scipy.odeint
        At each time step, each process evolves by one time step all the local atoms,
	calculates the correlations, and aggregates them by mpi_reduce. This is slower
        but better suited for large lattices
